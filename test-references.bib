  abstract = {We consider the radiation from a system of N identical two-level atoms coupled to a continuum of quantized em modes, and possibly, to an external driving field near resonance. The atoms can be distributed over a region large in comparison to the resonant wavelength, but smaller than the spontaneous pulse length. Radiation rates and correlation functions are expressed in terms of expectation values of time-dependent atomic operators, which are shown to satisfy coupled first-order differential equations involving similar atomic operators and the initial radiation operators. The corresponding equations for the expectation values simplify considerably if no driving field is present. Similar results are derived for a model in which each atom is replaced by a harmonic oscillator.},
